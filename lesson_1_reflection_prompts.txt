How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Let me see what was changed and address the issue

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I didn't have to think back to what was changed when and spend excess time finding out what broke

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros is that you can have less files meaning that you won't have to sift thorugh as much. 
	Cons is you may not remember to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google auto saves so it only uses one at a time, while with Git the user is choosing to save

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log [<options>] [<revision range>] [[\--] <path>…​]
	and 
	git diff <filename1> <filename2>

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know that I would be able to back out of my change easily so I would be more willing to make changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Utilize git to help become a more successful programmer
