When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with a team and you want them to be able to view your changes and propose updates

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may be working on files while other people are pushing files to the remote repository. You may not want
the files you are working on to be added to the files on the remote repository until you can review them
